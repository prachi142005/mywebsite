            <p id="initial-text">
                Pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing,
                 preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications, aiming 
                 to ensure the safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines. 
                 It is a miscellaneous science as it links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences and natural sciences.

                A pharmacy was always more than just a place to get your prescription. 
                Patients treated pharmacists as consultants, someone to help them choose
                 an over-the-counter medicine or make sense of a prescription's dosage and
                  instructions.
